Bozon - assignment 4

To run the code, either use
$ make 
$ ./sim [bozons] [mean sleep] [mean yodel] 

or 

edit the make file by uncommenting the ./sim lines
and run $ make. This allows you to run many tests very easily
and see all of the results.

if you want to see a less verbose output, comment out the 
print lines at the end of main.c and uncomment the last print statement
was originally commented. 

Testing was performed on Ubuntu on my personal computer and everything 
worked including the bonus.
